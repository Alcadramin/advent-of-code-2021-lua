### Advent of Code 2021 in Lua

My [**Advent of Code 2021**](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions in [**Lua**](https://www.lua.org/) scripting language which is a relatively simple and fast general purpose language. Lua is my first love :)

- Every problems solution lives in the day folder with the related chapter.
